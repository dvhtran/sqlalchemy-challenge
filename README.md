# Hawaii Climate Analysis
This repository contains a Python script for analyzing climate data in Honolulu, Hawaii. The analysis includes querying and exploring a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy, performing precipitation analysis, station analysis, and generating visualizations.

# Prerequisites

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Matplotlib
SQLAlchemy

# Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib sqlalchemy
Run the Jupyter Notebook file climate_analysis.ipynb to execute the climate analysis and generate visualizations.

# Instructions

The climate analysis script consists of several sections, each performing a specific task. Here is an overview of the main sections:

Reflecting Tables into SQLAlchemy ORM: This section connects to the SQLite database and reflects the tables using SQLAlchemy's automap functionality.

Exploratory Precipitation Analysis: This section retrieves the most recent date in the dataset and calculates the date range for the last 12 months. It then queries the precipitation data for that period and plots the results using Matplotlib.

Exploratory Station Analysis: This section calculates the total number of stations in the dataset and identifies the most active stations based on the number of rows. It also retrieves temperature data for the most active station and plots a histogram of the results.

Closing the Session: This section closes the SQLAlchemy session.

# Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook climate_analysis.ipynb.
Run each cell in sequential order to perform the climate analysis and generate the visualizations.
Review the analysis results and visualizations in the notebook.
